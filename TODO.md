## Next Session Start Point
1. Continue with test suite completion
   - Focus on remaining AgentClient methods
   - Add Docker integration tests
   - Complete experimental features testing

2. Begin documentation improvements
   - Start with API documentation
   - Add more usage examples
   - Create troubleshooting guide

3. Setup additional validation
   - Create platform-specific tests
   - Add offline installation verification
   - Test backup restoration process

## Notes
- Current test suite shows good progress but needs expansion
- Documentation needs significant work
- Platform compatibility needs verification
- Docker integration requires more testing
- Experimental features need better coverage

## Questions to Address
1. What are the critical paths that need testing?
2. What are the most common use cases to document?
3. Which platforms should we prioritize for testing?
4. What are the security considerations for the backup?
5. How should we handle version updates?

## Resources Needed
1. Access to different OS environments for testing
2. Docker environment for integration tests
3. Example use cases from actual usage
4. Platform-specific installation requirements
5. Security guidelines for offline packages
