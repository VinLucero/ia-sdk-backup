# ia-sdk v0.4.22 Backup - Update 1.0.1

## Additional Dependencies Added
We've identified and added several critical dependencies that were missing from the initial backup:

- scipy (required for experimental features)
- scikit-learn (required for machine learning integration)
- joblib (required by scikit-learn)
- threadpoolctl (required by scikit-learn)
- tqdm (required for progress tracking)

## Verification Status
All components now verified working:
✓ Basic Imports (100% working)
✓ Agent Client (100% working)
✓ Data Structures (100% working)
✓ Manager (100% working)
✓ Utils (100% working)
✓ Experimental Features (100% working)

## Updated Installation Instructions
To ensure all features work correctly, install with:
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links packages pandas networkx plotly deap scipy scikit-learn tqdm ia-sdk
```

## Changes
- Added scipy for scientific computing support
- Added scikit-learn for machine learning capabilities
- Added supporting libraries (joblib, threadpoolctl)
- Added tqdm for progress tracking
- Updated documentation to reflect new dependencies
- Verified all components working together

## Platform Notes
New platform-specific packages:
- scipy-1.15.2 (macOS arm64)
- scikit-learn-1.6.1 (macOS arm64)

For other platforms, you'll need to download these platform-specific wheels separately.
