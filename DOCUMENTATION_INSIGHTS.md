Now, let me explain why this documentation approach is specifically tailored to what we learned:

1. Complex Connection Flow
We discovered through testing that the connection process involves:
- Specific response format requirements
- Genome initialization
- Node configuration
- Error handling states

This is why the documentation plan emphasizes:
- Detailed connection examples
- Error handling patterns
- State management guides

2. Node Operations
Testing revealed that node operations require:
- Proper initialization
- Specific data structures
- Error handling
- State validation

3. Query System
We learned the query system needs:
- Proper method handling
- Response format understanding
- Error management
- State verification

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing any specific section?
2. Add more detail to certain areas?
3. Create example-focused documentation?
4. Something else?
