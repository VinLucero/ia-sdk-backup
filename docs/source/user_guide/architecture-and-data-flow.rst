Overview
-------

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the IA SDK architecture, system components, and data flow. Understanding these core concepts is essential for effective integration, debugging, and optimization of IA-powered applications.

System Components
---------------

The IA architecture consists of several interconnected components that work together to process observations and generate predictions.

Agent Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the highest level, the IA system is built around the concept of agents. An agent is a self-contained processing unit that:

* Receives observations in GDF format
* Processes data through a configurable pipeline
* Generates predictions based on patterns and learned behaviors
* Manages its own state and memory

   High-level architecture of an IA agent showing major components and information flow

The internal architecture of an agent includes:

* **Genome**: Configuration that defines processing behavior
* **Memory**: Storage for patterns, observations, and prediction history
* **Processing Nodes**: Specialized components that handle different aspects of data processing
* **Communication Layer**: Handles information exchange with clients and other agents
* **State Manager**: Maintains agent state across operations

Node Types and Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Agents contain multiple specialized node types, each responsible for specific aspects of data processing:

1. **Ingress Nodes (I-Nodes)**
   
   * Entry points for observation data
   * Responsible for initial validation
   * Handle authentication and rate limiting
   * Distribute incoming observations to appropriate processing nodes

2. **Processing Nodes (P-Nodes)**
   
   * Core data processing engines
   * Execute transformation operations on observations
   * Maintain pattern databases for matching
   * Generate prediction candidates based on observation matches
   * Apply genome parameters to processing decisions
   
3. **Query Nodes (Q-Nodes)**
   
   * Handle requests for stored data and predictions
   * Manage access to agent memory
   * Optimize response formats based on request parameters
   * Apply filtering and sorting to results
   
4. **Management Nodes (M-Nodes)**
   
   * Handle administrative operations
   * Maintain agent configuration
   * Monitor health and performance
   * Coordinate operations between other node types

Node distribution within an agent is configurable, with each agent potentially containing multiple instances of each node type for redundancy and load balancing.

**Practical Example: Customer Support Ticket Classification**

This example illustrates how different node types interact during a typical observation processing scenario:

.. code-block:: python

   from ia.gaius.agent_client import AgentClient
   from ia.gaius.utils import create_gdf
   import logging
   
   # Setup logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   
   # Initialize agent
   agent = AgentClient({
       'api_key': 'your-api-key',
       'name': 'support-classifier',
       'domain': 'your-domain',
       'secure': True
   })
   
   # 1. Connect and configure nodes (showing interaction with M-Nodes)
   agent.connect()
   logging.info("Connected to agent management node")
   
   # Configure load balancing across multiple processing nodes for higher throughput
   agent.set_ingress_nodes(['I1', 'I2'])
   agent.set_processing_nodes(['P1', 'P2', 'P3'])
   agent.set_query_nodes(['Q1', 'Q2'])
   
   # 2. Create and submit a support ticket observation (handled by I-Nodes)
   observation = create_gdf(
       strings=["Customer unable to reset password via mobile app. Error: AUTH-4501"],
       vectors=[],
       emotives={"urgency": 0.8, "customer_satisfaction": 0.3},
       metadata={"ticket_id": "SUP-1234", "customer_tier": "premium"}
   )
   
   # Submit to I-Node which validates and routes to P-Nodes
   logging.info("Submitting observation to ingress node I1")
   agent.observe(observation)
   
   # 3. Behind the scenes: P-Nodes process the observation
   # P1, P2, and P3 work in parallel on different aspects:
   # - P1 handles text classification using textual features
   # - P2 evaluates customer metadata and history 
   # - P3 incorporates emotional context
   
   # Wait for processing to complete
   agent.wait_for_processing()
   logging.info("Processing nodes completed observation analysis")
   
   # 4. Retrieve predictions via Q-Node
   logging.info("Querying results from query node Q1")
   raw_predictions = agent.get_predictions()
   
   # Q-Node formats, filters and returns predictions
   for i, prediction in enumerate(raw_predictions, 1):
       logging.info(f"Prediction {i}: {prediction.get_name()} - {prediction.get_confidence()}")
   
   # 5. Update agent configuration via M-Node based on performance
   processing_stats = agent.get_processing_statistics()
   if processing_stats['average_processing_time_ms'] > 500:
       logging.info("Processing time exceeds threshold, adding additional P-node")
       agent.set_processing_nodes(['P1', 'P2', 'P3', 'P4'])  # Scale up processing capacity

This example demonstrates how:

- I-Nodes serve as entry points, validating and routing observations
- P-Nodes handle the core processing in parallel for efficiency
- Q-Nodes manage the retrieval and formatting of predictions
- M-Nodes enable monitoring and dynamic configuration

**Advanced Node Interaction Examples**

The following examples illustrate more advanced node interaction patterns:

**Example 1: Multi-Node Processing for High-Volume Data**

           'secure': True
       })
       agent.connect()
       
       # Configure multiple nodes of each type for parallel processing
       agent.set_ingress_nodes(['I1', 'I2', 'I3'])  # Multiple ingress points
       
       # Configure specialized processing nodes for different aspects
       agent.set_processing_nodes([
           'P1', 'P2',  # Text processing specialists
           'P3', 'P4',  # Pattern matching specialists

           'pattern_matching': ['P3', 'P4'],  # Pattern matching on these nodes
           'metadata_processing': ['P5', 'P6'] # Metadata on these nodes
       })
       
       return agent
   
   # Process logs using concurrent observation processing
   def process_logs(log_entries, agent):
       """Process multiple log entries concurrently across nodes"""
       observations = [
           create_gdf(
               strings=[entry['message']],
               vectors=[],
               emotives={"severity": entry.get('severity', 0.5)},
               metadata={"timestamp": entry['timestamp'], "source": entry['source']}
           ) for entry in log_entries
       ]
       
       # Submit observations with routing hints for optimal node selection
       with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
           futures = []
           for i, obs in enumerate(observations):
               # Route different observations to different ingress nodes for load balancing
               ingress_node = f"I{(i % 3) + 1}"  # Round-robin across I1, I2, I3
               
               # Add processing hint based on content type
               if "error" in obs["strings"][0].lower():
                   processing_hint = "pattern_matching"  # Route to pattern matching specialists
               elif len(obs["strings"][0]) > 500:

               else:
                   processing_hint = "metadata_processing"  # Others to metadata specialists
                   
               # Submit with specific routing
               futures.append(
                   executor.submit(
                       agent.observe, 
                       obs, 
                       ingress_node=ingress_node,
                       processing_hint=processing_hint,
                       wait_for_processing=False
                   )
               )

           results.append(agent.get_predictions(query_node=query_node))
           
       return results

**Example 2: Node Failover and Recovery**

       }

   agent.set_query_nodes(['Q1'])  # Use Q1 for queries

Communication Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IA architecture implements a layered communication model:

1. **Client-Agent Communication**
   
   * REST-based API for client-to-agent communication
   * WebSocket connections for real-time updates
   * Secure TLS encryption for all external communication
   * Authentication via API keys and session tokens
   
2. **Inter-Node Communication**
   
   * High-performance binary protocol for node-to-node communication
   * Automatic routing based on operation type
   * Load balancing across available nodes
   * Fault tolerance with node failure detection and recovery
   
3. **Data Transport Layer**
   
   * Configurable compression for efficient data transfer
   * Batching for high-throughput operations
   * Streaming for large dataset handling
   * Protocol negotiation for optimal client-agent compatibility

Component Interaction Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Components in the IA architecture interact through several standard patterns:

1. **Request-Response**
   
   * Used for synchronous operations (queries, configuration)
   * Client initiates request and waits for agent response
   * Timeout handling for operational reliability
   
2. **Observe-Process-Notify**
   
   * Client submits observation (asynchronous)
   * Agent processes data independently
   * Notification when processing completes (optional)
   * Client queries for results when needed
   
3. **Publish-Subscribe**
   
   * Used for real-time updates and monitoring
   * Clients subscribe to specific event types
   * Agents publish events as they occur
   * Supports filtering and selective notification
   
4. **Batch Processing**
   
   * Used for high-volume operations
   * Multiple observations processed as a unit
   * Optimized for throughput over latency
   * Results retrievable as a batch or individually

The combination of these patterns enables flexible and efficient information flow throughout the system.

Data Flow Architecture
--------------------

The IA system implements a sophisticated data flow architecture to transform observations into predictions.

Complete Data Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full observation-to-prediction pipeline consists of several distinct stages:

1. **Observation Submission**
   
   * Client creates GDF-formatted observation
   * Observation submitted to agent via API
   * Ingress node validates and queues observation
   
2. **Initial Processing**
   
   * Format validation and normalization
   * Feature extraction and enrichment
   * Metadata parsing and validation
   
3. **Pattern Matching**
   
   * Feature comparison against stored patterns
   * Similarity scoring and ranking
   * Threshold filtering based on genome parameters
   
4. **Prediction Generation**
   
   * Creation of prediction objects from matches
   * Confidence calculation and calibration
   * Metadata association and propagation
   
5. **Result Storage**
   
   * Storing predictions in agent memory
   * Indexing for efficient retrieval
   * History tracking for future reference
   
6. **Result Retrieval**
   
   * Client requests predictions via API
   * Query node retrieves and formats predictions
   * Results returned to client

Data Transformation Stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Through the pipeline, data undergoes several transformations:

1. **Raw to Structured**
   
   * Client input converted to standardized GDF format
   * Validation against schema requirements
   * Type conversion and normalization
   
2. **Structured to Vectorized**
   
   * Text content tokenized and processed
   * Feature vectors extracted or computed
   * Dimensionality reduction for efficiency
   
3. **Vectorized to Matched**
   
   * Vector comparison against stored patterns
   * Match scoring and confidence calculation
   * Threshold filtering of low-quality matches
   
4. **Matched to Predicted**
   
   * Match information transformed to predictions
   * Metadata enrichment from pattern database
   * Confidence calibration based on genome parameters
   
5. **Predicted to Retrievable**
   
   * Predictions stored in queryable format
   * Indexed by relevant identifiers
   * Structured for efficient client access

Each transformation preserves essential information while optimizing for the next processing stage.

**Concrete Example: Network Issue Report Transformation**

The following example demonstrates how data transforms through each stage, using a network issue report:

**Stage 1: Raw to Structured**

*Input: User-reported issue text*

.. code-block:: text

   Customer John Smith reports intermittent connection drops on office WiFi network.
   Error messages on laptop show "Limited Connectivity". Started occurring after recent
   firmware update. Affects multiple devices.

*Transformation: Conversion to GDF format*

.. code-block:: python

   # Raw text converted to structured GDF
   observation = {
       "strings": [
           "Customer John Smith reports intermittent connection drops on office WiFi network.",
           "Error messages on laptop show \"Limited Connectivity\".",
           "Started occurring after recent firmware update.",
           "Affects multiple devices."
       ],
       "vectors": [],  # Empty initially, will be populated in next stage

Inter-Component Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Components exchange information through several mechanisms:

1. **Message Queues**
   
   * Asynchronous communication between nodes
   * Priority-based processing for critical operations
   * Persistence for reliability during node failures
   * Backpressure handling for load management
   
2. **Shared Memory**
   
   * High-performance data sharing between co-located nodes
   * Copy-on-write semantics for consistency
   * Memory-mapped files for large dataset handling
   * Reference counting for efficient resource management
   
3. **State Synchronization**
   
   * Periodic state updates between nodes
   * Eventual consistency model for distributed operation
   * Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
   * Versioned state for tracking changes
   
4. **Direct Calls**
   
   * Synchronous operations within a node
   * Optimized for performance-critical paths
   * Strong consistency guarantees
   * Transactional semantics where needed

The communication mechanism is selected based on performance requirements, reliability needs, and component locations.

State Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IA system uses a sophisticated state management approach:

1. **Agent State**
   
   * Genome configuration (processing parameters)
   * Node registry (available processing resources)
   * Session information (active connections)
   * Health metrics (performance indicators)
   
2. **Processing State**
   
   * Observation queue status
   * Active processing operations
   * Resource utilization metrics
   * Backpressure indicators
   
3. **Memory State**
   
   * Pattern database status
   * Observation history
   * Prediction cache
   * Temporary processing artifacts
   
4. **Client State**
   
   * Connection status
   * Authentication information
   * Subscription registrations
   * Pending operations

State is maintained through a combination of in-memory storage, persistent databases, and distributed state synchronization mechanisms.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example of state inspection
   agent = AgentClient(agent_info)
   agent.connect()
   
   # Retrieve agent state information
   state = agent.get_state()
   
   # Display state components
   print(f"Agent name: {state.agent_name}")
   print(f"Genome version: {state.genome_version}")
   print(f"Active nodes: {state.active_nodes}")
   print(f"Memory usage: {state.memory_usage_mb}MB")
   print(f"Pattern count: {state.pattern_count}")
   print(f"Observation queue: {state.queue_depth}")

Processing Pipeline
----------------

The IA processing pipeline converts observations to predictions through a series of well-defined stages.

Detailed Processing Stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each observation flows through the following detailed stages:

1. **Ingress Processing**
   
   * **Validation**: Schema validation of incoming GDF data

   * **Rate Limiting**: Traffic management based on client quotas
   * **Routing**: Directing observation to appropriate processing nodes
   
2. **Preprocessing**
   
   * **Normalization**: Text normalization (case, whitespace, etc.)
   * **Tokenization**: Breaking text into processable tokens
   * **Language Detection**: Identifying the observation language
   * **Feature Extraction**: Computing numerical features from text
   
3. **Vector Processing**
   
   * **Dimensionality Reduction**: Optimizing vector representations
   * **Vector Enrichment**: Adding derived features
   * **Context Integration**: Incorporating context from metadata
   * **Vector Indexing**: Preparing vectors for efficient comparison
   
4. **Pattern Matching**
   
   * **Initial Filtering**: Coarse filtering using efficient algorithms
   * **Detailed Comparison**: Precise similarity calculation
   * **Score Calculation**: Computing match confidence scores
   * **Threshold Application**: Filtering based on minimum confidence
   
5. **Prediction Formation**
   
   * **Candidate Selection**: Choosing top pattern matches
   * **Prediction Creation**: Building prediction objects
   * **Metadata Enrichment**: Adding context from patterns and agent
   * **Confidence Calibration**: Adjusting raw scores to calibrated confidence
   
6. **Post-Processing**
   
   * **Ensemble Creation**: Grouping related predictions
   * **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminating redundant predictions
   * **Sorting**: Ordering by relevance and confidence
   * **Format Preparation**: Structuring for client consumption

Each stage is configurable through genome parameters, allowing customization of processing behavior.

Queue Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Observations and intermediate results are managed through a sophisticated queuing system:

1. **Observation Queues**
   
   * Priority-based queuing for critical observations
   * Fair scheduling to prevent client starvation
   * Backpressure mechanisms for overload protection
   * Persistence for reliability during restarts
   
2. **Processing Queues**
   
   * Stage-specific queues for pipeline parallelism
   * Work stealing for load balancing across nodes
   * Batching for processing efficiency
   * Progress tracking for monitoring and reporting
   
3. **Result Queues**
   
   * Temporary storage for completed predictions
   * Time-based expiration for resource management
   * Notification triggers for client alerts
   * Indexing for efficient retrieval

Queue metrics are continuously monitored to detect bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example of queue monitoring
   agent = AgentClient(agent_info)
   agent.connect()
   
   # Retrieve queue metrics
   queue_metrics = agent.get_queue_metrics()
   
   # Display queue status
   for queue_name, metrics in queue_metrics.items():
       print(f"Queue: {queue_name}")
       print(f"  Depth: {metrics.current_depth}")
       print(f"  Average wait time: {metrics.avg_wait_ms}ms")
       print(f"  Processing rate: {metrics.items_per_second}/sec")
       print(f"  Backpressure: {metrics.backpressure_level}%")

Processing Optimizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The processing pipeline incorporates several optimization techniques:

1. **Computational Optimizations**
   
   * Vectorized operations for efficient numerical processing
   * Lazy evaluation for on-demand computation
   * Caching of intermediate results
   * Early termination for non-viable candidates
   
2. **Memory Optimizations**
   
   * Compact data representations
   * Memory pooling for frequent allocations
   * Reference counting for shared data
   * Garbage collection tuning for processing patterns
   
3. **Throughput Optimizations**
   
   * Batching of similar operations
   * Parallel processing across multiple cores
   * Pipelining of sequential operations
   * Asynchronous I/O for non-blocking operations
   
4. **Latency Optimizations**
   
   * Fast-path processing for common cases
   * Priority scheduling for latency-sensitive operations
   * Approximation algorithms for non-critical calculations
   * Predictive processing for anticipated operations

The specific optimizations applied depend on the agent's genome configuration and the characteristics of the incoming observations.

Resource Utilization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IA system dynamically manages computational resources:

1. **CPU Utilization**
   
   * Thread pool management for parallel processing
   * Affinity optimization for cache efficiency
   * Load-aware scheduling for consistent performance
   * Priority-based CPU allocation
   
2. **Memory Utilization**
   
   * Dynamic buffer sizing based on workload
   * Tiered storage (RAM, disk, remote) for different data categories
   * Compression for infrequently accessed data
   * Eviction policies for cache management
   
3. **Network Utilization**
   
   * Bandwidth throttling for fair allocation
   * Protocol selection based on payload characteristics
   * Connection pooling for efficient resource use
   * Adaptive compression based on network conditions
   
4. **Storage Utilization**
   
   * Tiered storage allocation (hot/warm/cold)
   * Automatic archiving of historical data
   * Data lifecycle policies for efficient retention
   * Background maintenance during low-usage periods

Resource utilization is continuously monitored and optimized based on workload patterns, with the system automatically adjusting resource allocation to maintain performance under varying loads.

.. code-block:: python

   # Example of resource monitoring and optimization
   agent = AgentClient(agent_info)
   agent.connect()
   
   # Retrieve resource utilization metrics
   resources = agent.get_resource_metrics()
   
   # Display current utilization
   print(f"CPU utilization: {resources.cpu_percent}%")
   print(f"Memory usage: {resources.memory_used_mb}MB / {resources.memory_total_mb}MB")
   print(f"Network throughput: {resources.network_throughput_mbps}Mbps")
   print(f"Storage utilization: {resources.storage_used_gb}GB / {resources.storage_total_gb}GB")
   
   # Optimize resource allocation based on workload
   if resources.cpu_percent > 80:
       # High CPU load - adjust processing strategy
       agent.set_processing_strategy("cpu_efficient")
   elif resources.memory_used_mb / resources.memory_total_mb > 0.9:
       # High memory usage - adjust memory management
       agent.set_memory_management("conservative")
   elif resources.network_throughput_mbps > 800:
       # High network usage - enable compression
       agent.set_network_compression(True)
