This page provides best practices and recommendations for using the ia-sdk effectively.

Data Preparation
----------------

**Use Appropriate Data Formats**

* Use the `create_gdf` utility to create properly formatted data
* Include meaningful strings that represent your data
* For numerical data, consider using vectors for better pattern recognition
* Use emotives to add context and importance to observations

.. code-block:: python

    from ia.gaius.utils import create_gdf

    # Good - using all relevant data types
    data = create_gdf(
        strings=["category|electronics", "product|smartphone"],
        vectors=[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]],
        emotives={"importance": 0.8}
    )

**Data Sequencing**

* Present related data in sequences for better pattern learning
* End sequences with classification events for supervised learning
* Keep sequences consistent in format and length

Learning and Training
---------------------

**Effective Model Building**

* Clear working memory between unrelated sequences
* Call `learn()` after each meaningful sequence
* Monitor KB size to avoid unnecessary growth
* Use targeted learning by setting specific genes

.. code-block:: python

    # Training loop best practices
    for training_sequence in training_data:
        agent.clear_wm()  # Start with fresh working memory
        
        for event in training_sequence[:-1]:
            agent.observe(event)
        
        # Observe classification separately
        agent.observe(training_sequence[-1])
        
        # Learn from the sequence
        agent.learn()

**Performance Optimization**

* Disable prediction during large-scale training with `stop_predicting()`
* Enable prediction only when needed with `start_predicting()`
* Adjust recall threshold based on your use case
* Use lower thresholds (0.01-0.1) for exploratory analysis
* Use higher thresholds (0.3-0.5) for precision

Memory Management
-----------------

**Efficient Resource Usage**

* Clear working memory (`clear_wm()`) between unrelated operations
* Clear all memory (`clear_all_memory()`) when starting fresh
* Export and save important knowledge bases
* Remove unnecessary symbols and models
* Periodically check memory usage with `show_status()`

Error Handling
--------------

**Robust Implementation**

* Implement proper error handling for all API calls
* Check return values and handle unexpected responses
* Use try/except blocks for critical operations

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        result = agent.observe(data)
        predictions = agent.get_predictions()
    except AgentConnectionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Connection failed: {e}")
        # Attempt to reconnect
        agent.connect()
    except AgentQueryError as e:
        logger.error(f"Query failed: {e}")
        # Handle invalid query
    finally:
        # Clean up resources regardless of success/failure
        agent.clear_wm()

Testing and Validation
----------------------

**Validating Agent Behavior**

* Test agent responses with known patterns first
* Gradually introduce complexity to validate understanding
* Use cross-validation techniques for evaluating model quality
* Monitor confusion matrices for classification tasks
* Compare performance against baseline methods

**Iterative Improvement**

* Start with simple models and incrementally add complexity
* Export and save knowledge bases at milestones
* Experiment with different gene settings for optimal performance
* Document configurations that work well for your specific use case

Deployment
----------

**Production Readiness**

* Use secure connections (HTTPS) for production environments
* Implement proper authentication handling and API key management
* Set appropriate timeouts for production traffic
* Implement retry logic for transient failures
* Monitor agent performance in production

**Scaling Considerations**

* Batch observations when possible for efficiency
* Implement connection pooling for multiple agents
* Use agent knowledge base exports for rapid deployment
* Consider distributed processing for high-volume applications

Summary
-------

Following these best practices will help you get the most out of the ia-sdk and avoid common pitfalls. Remember that each use case may require specific optimizations, so don't hesitate to experiment and adapt these recommendations to your needs.
